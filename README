What is this?
An IM server that allows users to telnet to it and chit chat with other users.

Why am I writing this?
I want to practice network programming in C. Maybe if I opensource this project it will become useful to somebody. Maybe not, but I will have source control and offsite backups :)

Why C?
I like Python, but C seems to be low level so it should have better efficiency. Furthermore programming C is a good way to get used to Linux/Unix system calls (sorry Windows users I don't plan to support it).

What can MyIM do?
When finished these features should be suported:
 - Connect to the server
 - Get a list of chat rooms
 - Join a chat room
 - Send and receive messages
 - Leave the chat room
